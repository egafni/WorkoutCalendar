      "B Wrist Routine (here is a post I made on the wrist routine: http://idoportal.blogspot.com/2009/07/preparations-for-our-daily-training.html) X 2 circuits \n",
      "*No need to film the whole routine, just two movements- Wrist Flexion Raises - with locked elbows flexing the wrists and lifting into the fingers support position - not fingertips but the whole fingers from the first knuckle in the base of the fingers and up to the fingertips should remain on the floor.\n",
      "Reverse Wrist Push Ups - from fists push up support position lower down slowly into the back of the palms and press back up to the fist, this time the motion includes elbows bending outwards.\n",

      "C1 Back Body Line Drill + 2.5 kg plate lower behind you and extend legs into the 'Line' / hold 60 sec\n",
      "(Lay on your back while lifting your legs until they are vertical. Lift your butt slightly off the floor by contracting your ab muscles in a slight 'reverse sit up' motion or just like lifting towards a candle stick. At the same time, lift your arms to the same vertical position with a 2.5 kg weighted instrument that allows a shoulder width grip. Make sure your whole back is pressed into the floor in the starting position, no space between your lower back and the floor. Start lowering your legs towards the floor as you lower also your arms back into the floor with the weight. Your objective is to go as close to the floor as possible without losing your lower back contact to the floor and holding that position for time. \n",

      "C2  Active Pigeon Stretch X 10 reps + 10 sec pause (per side)\n",
      "Active Pigeon is performed like this: from a front lunge stance, with the back leg on the toes and the front flat, place both hands on the sides of the front foot. Slowly externally rotate the front leg until the shin touches the floor in 90 degree position to the back leg. Do not allow any other angle and if impossible to reach the floor -just lower as deeply as you can. The back knee stays off the floor for the duration of the set. Keep rotating the front leg down and back into the lunge in a slow but dynamic fashion. Once you complete all the prescribed reps, pause for the last rep in the stretched position for the prescribed time.\n",

Contract your butt and abs and tilt your pelvis forward \u2013 and take your belly  off the floor without raking your ribs off the floor nor your thighs. Leave your nose lightly touching the floor and lift the stick off the floor with locked elbows. If impossible, widen your grip slightly. Hold the position for time without letting your stomach touch the floor nor the stick. Notice - FEET ARE ON THE FLOOR and not off it which means arching! \n",

      "D2 One Leg Good Morning X 10 reps + 10 sec pause (per side)\n",
      "One Leg GM is performed this way: stand on one leg (Right for example) and lift the other foot off the floor. Place your hand in the small of your back to check for the lordotic curve or stand sideways to a mirror to see it. Exaggerate the arch in your lower back as much as possible and with a locked knee start to fold forward slowly while maintaining the arch. Go as low as possible without losing the arch and when you cannot anymore - reverse the motion. Pause for the last rep in the stretched position for the duration prescribed. Tension will be felt on the back of the knee and hams. Start easy and increase ROM as you become better.\n",

You start in the bottom of a dip, as low as possible with elbows above rings. From there, while simultaneously false gripping and closing the rings to the center of the chest, you lean backwards and transition into the top part of a false grip pull up - elbows should be touching each other, hands supinated and wrists touching together as well, while false gripping. From there open up the rings into the arm pits while transitioning the elbows on top of the rings and shooting the chest through the ring line.
